# DecentBid
A decentralized application (DApp) implementing a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction with a commit-reveal protocol to ensure fair and private bidding.

## 📌 Overview

Traditional auctions are prone to manipulation, bid sniping, and privacy issues. *decentBid* solves these problems by leveraging smart contracts and cryptographic commitments to create a transparent, secure, and fair auction environment.

- 💡 **VCG Auction** – Truthful bidding is incentivized via the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism.
- 🔐 **Commit-Reveal** – Bid privacy is ensured through a cryptographic commit-reveal scheme.
- 🌐 **DApp** – Built using React, Node.js, and Hardhat for full-stack decentralized architecture.
